[Wikipedia]() is the most popular wiki site made with the help of [MediaWiki]()

this is a custom frontend for wikipedia, made using the mediawiki api, partly to brush up my web dev skills and partly because i am bored of the plain wikipedia ui.

the mediawiki api is a web service that allows us access to wiki operations like searching and fetching page contents
