### coolwiki

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) is the most popular wiki site on the internet made with the help of [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) software

this is a custom frontend for wikipedia, made using the mediawiki api, because i am bored of the plain wikipedia ui.

the mediawiki api is a web service that allows us access to wiki operations like searching and fetching page contents

#### dev notes
this project can still be improved upon a lot, so if you want to, feel free to contribute,

do try to avoid using any frameworks, even jquery, i want to keep this as simple as possible

here are a couple things this project needs work on :-
1) when you click on any link, it takes you to wikipedia, make it so that **links open inside coolwiki only**, you need to send the link title into the `page()` function [important feature]
2) **remove the `[edit]`** in front of titles, and any other unimportant things, such as the references and bibliography section
3) ***more themes.** since the point of this was to be a frontend for wikipedia, more themes will go a long way, make a dropdown list from which you can choose from, dark and light themes equally welcome!
4) **brush up the code.** if you think my code can be improved or made clearer, especially the js part, do it. Just try to avoid using things like jquery

happy surfing!
